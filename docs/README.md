# Innova Infrastructure Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Innova Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project. Our approach follows a documentation-first methodology to ensure well-designed, maintainable, and scalable infrastructure.

## Documentation Structure

### 📋 Architecture
- [`staging-architecture.md`](./architecture/staging-architecture.md) - Staging environment architecture design
- [`production-architecture.md`](./architecture/production-architecture.md) - Production environment architecture design  
- [`network-design.md`](./architecture/network-design.md) - Network topology and security design
- [`security-design.md`](./architecture/security-design.md) - Security architecture and controls

### 📊 Diagrams
- [`staging-network-diagram.md`](./diagrams/staging-network-diagram.md) - Staging network topology
- [`production-network-diagram.md`](./diagrams/production-network-diagram.md) - Production network topology
- [`security-boundaries.md`](./diagrams/security-boundaries.md) - Security zones and boundaries
- [`data-flow-diagram.md`](./diagrams/data-flow-diagram.md) - Application and data flow patterns

### 📝 Requirements
- [`staging-requirements.md`](./requirements/staging-requirements.md) - Staging environment requirements
- [`production-requirements.md`](./requirements/production-requirements.md) - Production environment requirements
- [`security-requirements.md`](./requirements/security-requirements.md) - Security and compliance requirements
- [`monitoring-requirements.md`](./requirements/monitoring-requirements.md) - Monitoring and alerting requirements

### 🔧 Specifications
- [`compute-specifications.md`](./specifications/compute-specifications.md) - VM and compute resource specs
- [`networking-specifications.md`](./specifications/networking-specifications.md) - Network configuration details
- [`storage-specifications.md`](./specifications/storage-specifications.md) - Storage and backup configurations
- [`deployment-procedures.md`](./specifications/deployment-procedures.md) - Deployment and maintenance procedures

## Development Process

1. **📋 Documentation Phase**: Design and document architecture
2. **🧪 Staging Implementation**: Deploy and test staging environment
3. **✅ Staging Validation**: Validate all functionality in staging
4. **🚀 Production Deployment**: Deploy validated configuration to production
5. **📊 Monitoring & Maintenance**: Ongoing monitoring and updates

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Staging Architecture](./architecture/staging-architecture.md)
2. Examine the [Network Design](./diagrams/staging-network-diagram.md)
3. Understand [Security Requirements](./requirements/security-requirements.md)
4. Follow [Deployment Procedures](./specifications/deployment-procedures.md)
